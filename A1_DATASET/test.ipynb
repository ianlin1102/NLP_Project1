      "<s> I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott . We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators , which are used all night long . When speaking to the front desk , I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor , which I had requested for a better view . I am looking at a brick wall , and getting no sleep . He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor , and were aware of the noise problem . Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked ? A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this . If you decide to stay here , request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator ! I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences . This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain . </s>\n",
      "<s> I LOVED this hotel . The room was so chic and trendy , the bed was comfortable , great slippers and robes . I love the Keihl 's bath products in the bathroom . We went during my birthday weekend , and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room . We got a great deal on a junior suite from Travelzoo , but when we tried to take another trip to Chicago , the deal was gone . I really recommend the hotel . I LOVED it . The ONLY problem we had was with the David Burke Steakhouse . The service was horrible , they switched our order with the table next to our 's and the only compensation was they took off a $ 7 side dish we ordered ( and they were nice enough to NOT charge us for the other side dish we DID N'T get ) . DO N'T go there . Go to the Lawry 's accross the street . But stay at the James . ( BTW- its not a 3-star hotel like the website lists- its at least 4-star ) </s>\n"
